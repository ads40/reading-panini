# Pāṇini and traditional Indian grammar

Any student of Sanskrit soon comes across the name of Pāṇini and concepts drawn
from the Indian grammatical tradition.

Here I document the process of learning more about this tradition.

To get started on this topic, one could do far worse than begin with Vikram
Chandra's [eloquent piece about Pāṇini](https://blog.granthika.co/panini/): he
writes as a knowledgeable non-specialist and in a readable and scholarly way
that is acutely informed by [Chandra's "twin obsessions---writing and
coding"](https://www.vikramchandra.com/).

## Why Pāṇini?

The study of Sanskrit has long been divided between "traditional" and
"philological" approaches.

The traditional methods of learning Sanskrit are of some antiquity (and some
texts and aspects of the tradition are really quite ancient), and this tradition
is still found in a living form in modern India.

Philological methods are of more recent origin, especially as manifested in
nineteenth century German and Anglophone scholarship. This philology was often
grounded in the colonial appropriation of materials of linguistic, literary or
historical interest at the expense (and often the explicit rejection) of the
accompanying philosophical and religious contexts in which these materials are
embedded in their indigenous existence.

There is often a profound gap between the two approaches.

The story of William Jones' time in India shows the anthropological tension
between the 'emic' and the 'etic' at work. On the one side stood the pandits, an
integral source for Jones' "discovery" of Sanskrit and the *dharmaśāstra*; and
on the other side loomed the weight of Jones' classically and biblically
grounded education.

The degree to which the indigenous sources of knowledge have been treated as
necessary but unfortunate is exemplified in the work of William Whitney, but can
be illustrated in many places (For example, Whitney's "The Study of Hindu
Grammar and the Study of Sanskrit", reproduced in [[Staal 1972]], pp. 142--154;
see also [[Staal 1972]], pp. 70--101 for Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar's earlier
writings on the question of 'European' and 'Indian' perspectives.). Whitney
emphatically rejects what he regards as the distortingly prescriptivist Indian
tradition in the domain of linguistics and grammar ('the native grammarians',
'the Hindu grammarians') in the midst of Whitney's own trenchant battles within
the newly emerging domain of linguistic science (See [[Goldsmith and Laks
2019]], pp. 100--107).

In the midst of all this is Pāṇini.

Pāṇini is simultaneously the oldest surviving component of the Indian
grammatical tradition and the Indian grammatical text most often cited as an
explicit inspiration for a number of key figures in the history of modern
linguistics, including Bopp, de Saussure, Bloomfield and Jakobson.
