Bloomfield, Leonard. 1929. Review of *Konkordanz Pāṇini-Candra*, by Bruno Liebich. *Language* 5 (4): 267–76.

In the guise of a review of Liebich's *Konkordanz Pāṇini-Candra* (1928), about
which he writes only one paragraph directly, Bloomfield goes to some
length to justify the importance of Pāṇini in the history of language analysis.

Bloomfield first sets out ways the philological approach to the study of the Indian
grammarians was founded on misconceptions and prejudice.

> Pāṇini was describing a colloquial speech, a conservative upper-class
> language, to be sure, but a language native to him and used in everyday life
> by the Brahmins. (p. 269)
>
> [B]ecause the Indians had not discovered the history of language, their work
> was supposed to be negligible. One forgot that the comparative grammar of the
> Indo-European languages got its start only when the Pāṇinean analysis of an
> Indo-European language became known in Europe. (p. 270)

Bloomfield then summarises how Pāṇini's compression of his "complete description
of a language" was achieved and the difficulties that has brought for
intelligibility, together with an overview of the subsequent history of Indian
scholarly work engaging with Pāṇini.
