This text expresses the generative rules of Pāṇini's grammatical system in the
form of a set of *sūtra*s.

The name can be expressed more fully: aṣṭādhyāyīsūtrapāṭhaḥ,
"eight-chapter-rule-text".

- aṣṭan "eight"
- adhyāya "lesson, chapter"
- sūtra "thread, string", and hence "a short sentence or aphoristic rule" (MW)
- pāṭha "reading, study", and hence a "text" (MW)

There are several different types of rules within the system.

saṃjñā-sūtram
: A rule that defines a *technical* term within the system.

paribhāṣā-sūtram
: A rule that provides an *interpretation* for the application of other rules.

vidhi-sūtram
: A rule that mandates an *operation* on an input.

niyama-sūtram
: A rule that *restricts* the operation of another rule.

atideśa-sūtram
: A rule that *extends* the scope of another rule.

adhikāra-sūtram
: A rule that acts as a *domain heading* for subsequent rules.
