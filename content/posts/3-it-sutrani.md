# A starting point

In her study guide, Michika takes the *it-sūtrāṇi* from the *Aṣṭādhyāyī* as the
starting point for the subsequent study of of Pāṇini's grammar.

This starting point remains preparatory work *prior* to embarking on the
*Laghusiddhāntakaumudī* itself. The motivation seems to be that, although the
beginning of the LSK does progressively present what is to be termed *it* in the
grammar, the *it-sūtrāṇi* form a clear block that illustrates the basic working
of Pāṇini's sutra-style, and the role of *anuvṛtti* in fleshing out the bare
text of the sutras themselves.

There are lots of definitions to absorb here:

- **anuvṛtti**: literally, "continuation" -- the continued relevance of (words
  from) a previous rule in subsequent rules --
  [anuvṛtti](@/glossary/anuvrtti.md).

- **upadeśa**: the various texts used in teaching Pāṇinian grammar --
  [upadeśa](@/glossary/upadesa.md).

- **saṃjñā**: a technical term used in the grammar --
  [saṃjñā](@/glossary/samjna.md).

- **saṃjñī**: the entity referred to by a technical term -- see
  [saṃjñā](@/glossary/samjna.md).

Note also the different kinds of *sūtra* used in distinct ways within the
[Aṣṭadhyāyī](@/texts/astadhyayi.md).

## The *it-sūtrāṇi* (1.3.2--1.3.9)

As a group, the *it-sūtrāṇi* identify the letters used as markers (called by the
name *it*) in and around morphemes.

- (1.3.2) Nasalised vowels are used as *it*.
- (1.3.3) Final consonants are used as *it* ...
- (1.3.4) ... except for *t*-series (*t--n*), *s*, *m* as final in the *sup* and
  *tiṅ* sets of suffixes.
- (1.3.5) The syllables *ñi*, *ṭu* and *ḍu* at the beginning of a verb-root are
  used as *it*.
- (1.3.6) The letter *ṣ* at the beginning of a suffix is used as *it*
- (1.3.7) The *c*-series (*c--ñ*) and the *ṭ*-series (*ṭ--ṇ*) at the beginning
  of a suffix are used as *it*.
- (1.3.8) The letters *l*, *ś* and the *k*-series at the beginning of
  non-*taddhita* (i.e. not secondary nominal derivations) suffixes are used as
  *it*.
- (1.3.9) The marker (*it*) is deleted.

## The form and function of a sutra

The first *it-sūtram* is 1.3.2, and there is no "continuation" (anuvṛtti) here:
the sutra is to be understood by itself.

> <span class="devanagari"> 1.3.2 उपदेशेऽजनुनासिक इत्।

> **upadeśe 'janunāsika it** \
> *upadeśe ac anunāsikaḥ it* \
> "In the teachings (*loc.*) nasalised vowels (*nom.*) are *it* (*nom.*)."

- *upadeśe*: locative, *the context* for the rule
- *ac anunāsikaḥ*: nominative, the entity referred to (*saṃjñī*)
- *it*: nominative, the technical term (*saṃjñā*)

### The **LSK**'s expansion

> **LSK:** upadeśe anunāsikaḥ ac it-saṃjñakaḥ syāt \
> In the key grammatical teachings, let nasalised vowels be termed *it*.

The **LSK**'s expansion makes the *saṃjñā* explicit (*it-saṃjñakaḥ*), and
supplies a verb (*syāt*).
