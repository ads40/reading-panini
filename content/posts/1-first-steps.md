# First steps

Reading Pāṇini is far from straightforward. The *Aṣṭādhyāyī* is a complex system
rather than a straightforward text, even if it also encodes instructions for its
own use.

Accordingly, access to the system requires initiation into its mechanisms.

There is an apparatus in the Indian tradition for this process of initiation.

One route is via the *Laghusiddhantakaumudi*. Medhā Michika has written a study
guide for Pāṇini's grammatical system using the *Laghusiddhantakaumudi*:
[Michika 2017 Vol 1](@/biblio/michika_2017_vol_1.md). The first four sections of this study are available
for download at
[the website of the Arsha Avinash Foundation](https://arshaavinash.in/index.php/books-on-sanskrit-grammar/).

I propose to begin in this way.

Michika's work presents the Pāṇinian sūtras together with an apparatus: the
*vṛtti*s, and relevant *paribhāṣā* rules. Michika supplements the
*Laghusiddhantakaumudi* where required (e.g. with a section on the
paribhāṣā-sūtrāṇi).
