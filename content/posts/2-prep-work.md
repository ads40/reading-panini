# Prep work

There is a lot to be familiar with before embarking on Pāṇinian grammar via the
*Laghusiddhāntakaumudī*.

In her study guide, Michika sets out a range of introductory matter before
embarking upon the *Laghusiddhāntakaumudī* proper, including an introduction to
the *it*-rules, the different types of sūtras found in the *Aṣṭādhyāyī*, and a
section on the *paribhāṣā*-rules which is otherwise not included in the
*Laghusiddhāntakaumudī*.

There is also the assumption built into Michika's text from the beginning that
the *Śivasūtrāṇi* are already known by the student (since she introduces them in
Book 2 of her *Enjoyable Sanskrit Grammar* series.)

Only once these pieces are in place does Michika venture upon the beginning of
the text of the *Laghusiddhāntakaumudī* itself.

## Pratyāhārasūtrāṇi or Śivasūtrāṇi or Māheśvarasūtrāṇi

The groupings of sounds most commonly known as the Śivasūtrāṇi or
Māheśvarasūtrāṇi form a foundational element of Pāṇinian grammar.

The following terms are used, moving from the more technical to the more popular.

- akṣarasamāmnāya "traditional recitation of sound-elements"
- varṇasamāmnāya "traditional recitation of sounds"
- pratyāhārasūtrāṇi "(sound) abstraction sūtras"
- śivasūtrāṇi "the Shiva sūtras"
- māheśvarasūtrāṇi "the Maheshvara sūtras"

The *Śivasūtrāṇi* exhibit a number of characteristics of Pāṇinian grammar:

- Extreme economy
- Heightened phonological awareness
- Use of techniques of abstraction (pratyāhāra, literally "withdrawal")

There are fourteen sūtras, each collecting between one and eight sounds:

1. a i u Ṇ
2. ṛ ḷ K
3. e o Ṅ
4. ai au C
5. ha ya va ra Ṭ
6. la Ṇ
7. ña ma ṅa ṇa na M
8. jha bha Ñ
9. gha ḍha dha Ṣ
10. ja ba ga ḍa da Ś
11. kha pha cha ṭha tha ca ṭa ta V
12. ka pa Y
13. śa ṣa sa R
14. ha L

The sequences need to be learned by heart to enable ready recognition of the
labels used to identify groups of sounds within the grammar.

The capitalised letters are called *anubandha*s: using these letters, you can
refer to a group of sounds in a single syllable by combining the initial sound
with the *anubandha* letter at the end of the sequence. For example, iK is the
sequence i u ṛ ḷ (leaving aside the *anubandha* letters: these are markers, not
sounds), and aC is the set of vowels (a i u ṛ ḷ e o ai au).

[Cardona 1997](@/biblio/cardona_1997.md) gives a list of the 41 *pratyāhāra*s
that Pāṇini uses in the *Aṣṭādhyāyi*. See the notes on
[pratyãhāra](@/glossary/pratyahara.md) and the
[Aṣṭādhyāyī](@/texts/astadhyayi.md) for these combinations.

Note that for the consonants, the inherent vowel -a- is included in the sūtras
so that the consonants can be more readily pronounced, but it is only the
consonant itself that is relevant for the abstraction.

Note also that for the series of stops produced at the same point of
articulation Pāṇini uses the *anubandha* *U* which does not appear in the
*pratyāhārasūtrāṇi*. Accordingly, the velar series *k kh g gh* is referred to as
*kU*, and the palatal series *c ch j jh* as *cU*, and so on.
