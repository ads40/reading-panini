# pratyāhāra

This term designates a key technique in Pāṇinian grammar, but the term itself is not found in Pāṇini.

## Definitions

### Abhyankar Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar

> प्रत्याहार lit. bringing together; bringing together of several letters (or
> words in a few cases, such as roots or nouns) by mentioning the first and the
> last only for the sake of brevity; the term प्रत्याहार is generally used in
> connection with brief terms such as अण्, अक्, अच्, हल् and the like, created
> by Pāṇini in his grammar by taking any particular letter and associating it
> with any mute final letter (अनुबन्ध) of the fourteen Śivasūtras, with a view
> to include all letters beginning with the letter uttered and ending with the
> letter which precedes the (mute) letter. The practice of using such
> abbreviations was in existence before Pāṇini, possibly in the grammar
> attributed to Indra. The term प्रत्याहार is not actually used by Pāṇini; it is
> found in the Rk. Tantra; cf. प्रत्याहारार्थो वर्णोनुबन्धो व्यञ्जनम् R.T.I.3
> The term appears to have come into use after Pāṇini. Pāṇini has not given any
> definition of the term प्रत्याहार. He has simply given the method of forming
> the Pratyāhāras and he has profusely used them; cf. आदिरन्त्येन सहेता P.
> I.1.71. The word कृञ् in P. III.1.40 and तृन् in P. II.3.69 are used as
> Prayāhāras. For a list of the Pratyāhāras which are used by Pāṇini see Kāśikā
> on the Māheśvara Sūtras.
