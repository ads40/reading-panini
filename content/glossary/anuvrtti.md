# *anuvṛtti*: continued rule application

This term refers to the continued relevance of (words from) an earlier rule to
subsequent rules. The omission of these words from the sūtra achieves economy of
expression, at the expense of needing to know how far the *anuvṛtti* applies.

There are several types of *anuvṛtti*.

The text of the *Aṣṭādhyāyī* is typically presented together with the *anuvṛtti*.

E.g. *sūtra* in bold and *anuvṛtti* following

> <span class="devanagari">1.3.4 **न विभतक्तौ तुँस्माः।** ~ उपदेशे इत् (1.3.2) हल् अन्त्यम् (1.3.3)
