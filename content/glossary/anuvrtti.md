# *anuvṛtti*: continued rule application

This term refers to the continued relevance of (words from) an earlier rule to
subsequent rules. The omission of these words from the sūtra achieves economy of
expression, at the expense of needing to know how far the *anuvṛtti* applies.

There are several types of *anuvṛtti*.

The text of the *Aṣṭādhyāyī* is typically presented together with the *anuvṛtti*.

E.g. *sūtra* in bold and *anuvṛtti* following

> <span class="devanagari">1.3.4 **न विभतक्तौ तुँस्माः।** ~ उपदेशे इत् (1.3.2) हल् अन्त्यम् (1.3.3)

## Bloomfield's comment on the _anuvṛtti_

> A third method of abbreviation is less happy. Although the basic arrangement
> of Pinini's treatise was relevant to the subject-matter, he subordinated this
> logical order to a requirement of conciseness: every rule is so placed that as
> many as possible of its words can be replaced by ditto marks because they
> repeat words of the preceding rule. For this purpose so many rules are torn
> from their natural place that the basic structure of the grammar is to a large
> extent obscured. Worst of all, the ditto marks (_anuvṛtti_) and their cessation
> (_nivṛtti_) at the end of a series of rules are not actually written in the
> treatise as we have it.
